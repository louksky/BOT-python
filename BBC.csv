Syrian army heads north towards Turkish advance;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50039106;"Syria's army has started to reach the north of the country, hours after the government agreed to help Kurdish forces facing Turkey.State media said government forces, which are backed by Russia, had entered the strategic town of Tal Tamer, 30km (19 miles) south of the Turkish border.The deal came after the US, the Kurds' main ally, said it would withdraw its remaining troops from northern Syria.Turkey's offensive aims to push Kurdish forces from the border region.Areas under the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) came under heavy bombardment over the weekend, with Turkey making gains in the key border towns of Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad.Dozens of civilians and fighters have been killed on both sides.On Sunday, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper announced the Pentagon was moving up to 1,000 troops away from the north, citing fears that US forces would end up stuck between ""two opposing advancing armies"".The Turkish offensive and US withdrawal have been internationally criticised, as the SDF were the main allies of the West in defeating the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria. There are fears about a possible resurgence of the group and the escape of prisoners amid the instability.According to the Kurdish-led administration in northern Syria, Sunday's agreement will allow the Syrian army to deploy along border areas controlled by Kurdish forces to ""repel [Turkish] aggression"".It is the first time government troops will enter those areas since 2012, when forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad withdrew to fight rebels elsewhere, letting Kurdish militias take control.The deal represents a significant shift in alliances for the Kurds, who said they had been ""stabbed in the back"" by President Donald Trump after he pulled dozens of US troops from pockets in the north-east last week.The move effectively paved the way for the operation by Turkey, which views elements of the Kurdish groups in Syria as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades.Apart from being important partners in fighting IS in Syria, the Kurds were fundamental for Washington in limiting the influence of Russia and Iran, key allies of President Assad and US rivals, and keeping some leverage on the ground.For now, Syrian forces will not be deployed between Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain, where Turkey has focused its efforts. Apart from Tal Tamer, government troops also entered Ain Issa, according to state media.The crisis in north-eastern Syria is also a crisis for Nato with both practical and political implications. The immediate fear is that much of the progress made towards defeating IS could be undone.President Trump's willingness to throw the Kurds to the wolves has not gone down well with many allies; France, Germany and perhaps less stridently, Britain, have all urged the Turks to halt their operation. Spain has threatened to pull out its Patriot missile battery in Turkey in protest.Mr Trump, who did little to try to stop the operation, has equally threatened to ""totally destroy and obliterate"" the Turkish economy if they go too far - an extraordinary statement coming from one Nato member to another.Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says that despite his deep concerns, Turkey will remain an important member of the alliance. He insists that Nato will get over its current divisions. But if you add to this crisis Ankara's recent decision to purchase Russian surface-to-air missiles, there is a clear sense that Turkey is slowly drifting away from it.On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would not back down its offensive ""no matter what anyone says"", adding that the operation would continue until ""ultimate victory is achieved"".Turkey wants to push Kurdish forces away from a ""safe zone"" reaching 32km into Syria, to where it will resettle up to two million Syrian refugees currently in Turkey. Many of them are not Kurds and critics warn this could lead to ethnic cleansing of the local Kurdish population.The Russian government, a close ally of Mr Erdogan, said it did not want to entertain the possibility of a clash between Russian and Turkish forces in Syria, and said it was in regular contact with Turkey's authorities.Earlier, President Trump suggested Kurdish forces might have released IS prisoners on purpose to draw the US into the conflict. ""Big sanctions on Turkey coming!"" he added, without giving details.In other developments:At least 50 civilians have been killed inside Syria and 18 over the border in southern Turkey, reports say. Kurdish forces have confirmed the deaths of 56 of their fighters while Turkey says four of its soldiers and 16 pro-Turkish Syrian fighters have been killed in Syria.Up to 160,000 civilians had been displaced, according to UN humanitarian agency OCHA, which said the number was expected to rise.The fighting has also spilled over to areas close to IS detainee camps, and officials at the Ain Issa camp said nearly 800 relatives of foreign IS members had escaped. The camp holds about 12,000 displaced people, previously including nearly 1,000 foreign women and children with jihadist links.Turkey has said it will take responsibility for IS prisoners it finds during its offensive.On Sunday, President Erdogan said his forces had already captured 109 sq km (42 square miles) of territory, including 21 villages.Have you been getting these songs wrong?What happens to your body in extreme heat?"
Hunter Biden to step down from China company board;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50034500;"The son of US presidential contender Joe Biden is to step down from the board of a Chinese company amid fierce attacks by President Donald Trump.Hunter Biden would also not work for any foreign-owned companies if his father were elected, his lawyer said.Mr Trump has called on China and Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden over his son's activities in both countries, without any evidence of any wrongdoing.The issue is central to an impeachment inquiry against the US president.Mr Trump and his supporters have accused Joe Biden of abusing his power when he was vice-president to pressure Ukraine to back away from a criminal investigation that could have implicated his son who then worked for a Ukrainian energy company.He has also accused Hunter, 49, of using his position of influence to get China to invest in a fund he was involved in.The impeachment inquiry begun by opposition Democrats in the US House of Representatives centres on allegations that the president broke the law by soliciting help from a foreign power - Ukraine - for electoral gains.A statement released through Hunter's lawyer said he would resign by 31 October from the board of BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company.It said he joined the board in an unpaid position ""based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets"".The statement said Hunter would ""readily comply"" with guidelines issued by his father if he was elected president ""to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts"", and would, ""in any event"", agree not to serve on the boards of or work on behalf of foreign-owned companies.The statement also detailed the nature of his work in Ukraine and China, stressing that there had been no wrongdoing.Mr Trump has accused the former US vice-president and his son Hunter of corruption in their political and business dealings in Ukraine and China, without offering specific evidence.When Hunter Biden joined the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma in 2014, questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest for his father.Ukraine was undergoing a political transition after its pro-Russia president was forced out of office, while the elder Biden was the Obama administration's point man for the Eastern European country.In 2016, Joe Biden pushed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, whose office had been scrutinising the oligarch owner of Burisma.In a speech last year at a think tank, Joe Biden boasted of having forced the prosecutor out by threatening to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee to Ukraine.Mr Trump and his allies accuse Joe Biden of acting to protect his son. However, other Western officials and major financers of Ukraine's government also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because he was seen as a barrier to anti-corruption efforts.A Democratic-led inquiry is trying to establish whether Mr Trump withheld nearly $400m (£327m) in aid to nudge Ukraine's newly elected President Volodymyr Zelensky into launching an inquiry into Joe Biden and his son.In a phone call on 25 July, Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky for help on the issue.A whistleblower raised concerns about the phone call, prompting the launch of a formal impeachment investigation last month.The White House this month sent an eight-page letter to top Democrat and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, calling the inquiry ""constitutionally invalid"" and therefore stating that President Trump would not be co-operating.Have you been getting these songs wrong?What happens to your body in extreme heat?"

Protest over black woman's killing by Texas police;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50044939;"Residents in Forth Worth, Texas, have held a protest outside the home of a black woman who was shot dead by police through her bedroom window.A vigil became a demonstration as residents demanded justice for Atatiana Jefferson, 28, who was killed by a white officer.A neighbour had called a non-emergency police number after growing concerned that her front door was open at night.Body cam footage shows an officer shooting within seconds of seeing her.In a statement, the Fort Worth Police Department said that the officer had ""perceived a threat"" when he drew his weapon. He has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.Participants in Sunday's protest marched in front of Jefferson's house, holding candles and chanting: ""No justice, no peace."" Many called for the officer to be fired and criminally prosecuted.""State sanctioned violence has always been a culture for black people,"" said protester Michelle Andersen, at Sunday's gathering. ""It's not about a training issue.""Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price was present at the vigil, but left after she was approached by protesters shouting ""lock him up"", in reference to the unidentified officer, CBS News reported.""It's another one of those situations where the people that are supposed to protect us are actually not here to protect us,"" Jefferson's sister, Amber Carr, told CBS. ""You want to see justice, but justice don't bring my sister back.""The shooting happened at about 02:30 local time (07:30 GMT) on Saturday.Body cam footage of the incident shows police searching the perimeter of Jefferson's property, before noticing a figure at the window. After demanding that the person put their hands up, an officer then fired through the glass.Jefferson been playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew before she went to investigate the noise outside the window and was shot, said a lawyer representing her family.The officers involved did not park their marked cars in front of her house and did not identify themselves as police, officials said.The man who called police, James Smith, 62, told local media he was trying to be a good neighbour.""If I had never dialled the police department, she'd still be alive."" Mr Smith told local media. ""It makes you not want to call the police department.""The officer is expected to be interviewed by the police department's major case unit on Monday.Jefferson's murder comes two weeks after Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, 31, was found guilty of murdering 26-year-old Botham Jean.Last year Guyger shot and killed Jean as he sat eating ice cream on his apartment sofa, less than 35 miles (55km) from Saturday's incident. Guyger testified she mistakenly thought she was in her own flat and believed Jean to be an intruder.At trial, Guyger admitted to shooting ""an innocent man"".""This is a victory for black people in America,"" said civil rights lawyer Lee Merritt after the verdict was read. ""Police officers are going to be held accountable for their actions.""Have you been getting these songs wrong?What happens to your body in extreme heat?"
US slaps sanctions on Turkey over Syria offensive;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50050264;"The US has sanctioned two Turkish ministries and three senior government officials in response to the country's military offensive in northern Syria.President Donald Trump also phoned his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to demand an immediate truce, Vice-President Mike Pence said.Mr Pence said he would travel to the region ""as quickly as possible"".Syria's army earlier entered areas in the north-east. This could result in a confrontation with Turkish-led forces.The Syrian army deployment followed a deal with Kurdish-led forces, who until last week were US allies.Turkey says its offensive aims to push Kurdish forces from the border region and establish what the government in Ankara describes as a ""safe zone"".With a ""safe zone"" reaching about 30km (20 miles) into Syria, Turkey wants to resettle up to two million Syrian refugees currently on its territory.Many of them are not Kurds and critics warn this could lead to ethnic cleansing of the local Kurdish population.Speaking to reporters in Washington DC on Monday evening, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described the sanctions as ""very strong"" which would have a severe impact on the Turkish economy.The US Treasury published a statement, which said that action was taken ""against two [Turkish] ministries and three senior Turkish government officials in response to Turkey's military operations in Syria"".""The Turkish government's actions are endangering innocent civilians, and destabilizing the region, including undermining the campaign to defeat ISIS [Islamic State],"" the statement added.Appearing alongside Mr Mnuchin, Vice-President Pence warned that the sanctions ""will continue and will worsen unless and until Turkey embraces an immediate ceasefire, stops the violence and agrees to negotiate a long-term settlement of the issues along the border between Turkey and Syria"".Mr Pence said that President Trump reiterated this in Monday's phone call with President Erdogan.The vice-president also reiterated that the US ""did not give a green light to Turkey to invade Syria"".The US earlier said that the Turkish ""unacceptable"" incursion into Syria has resulted in the release of many captured IS fighters.Earlier on Monday, European Union countries committed to suspending arms exports to Turkey but stopped short of an EU-wide arms embargo.In response, Turkey said it would examine its co-operation with the EU due to its ""unlawful and biased"" attitudeSyrian state media said Russian-backed government forces had entered the strategic town of Manbij, inside the area where Turkey wants to create a ""safe zone"".Turkish troops and their allied Syrian militias were gathering near the town.The deal with Kurdish-led forces was seen as a boost for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as his troops would return to north-eastern areas for the first time since 2012, when their withdrawal to fight rebels elsewhere allowed Kurdish militias to take control.Despite disagreeing with their attempts at self-rule, Mr Assad did not seek to retake the territory, especially after the Kurds became partners in the coalition against IS with US troops on the ground.Apart from fighting IS, the Kurds were fundamental for the US in limiting the influence of rivals Russia and Iran and keeping some leverage on the ground.For now, Syrian forces will not be deployed between Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain, where Turkey has focused its efforts. Kurdish-led officials insisted they would remain in charge politically, and retain order in the area.The Russian government, a close ally of Mr Erdogan, said it did not want to entertain the possibility of a clash between Russian and Turkish forces in Syria, and said it was in regular contact with Turkey's authorities.Up to 160,000 civilians had been displaced, according to UN humanitarian agency OCHA, which said the number was expected to rise.At least 50 civilians have been killed inside Syria and another 18 over the border in southern Turkey, reports say.

US treasury chief warns China of $156bn in new tariffs;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50047229;"New tariffs on $156bn of Chinese goods will be imposed if a trade deal is not finalised by 15 December, the US Treasury Secretary has warned.Steven Mnuchin said he still hoped a tentative US-China deal agreed last week to suspend fresh tariffs would be formally approved.But his caution, during a CNBC interview, seemed in contrast with President Trump's optimism last week.Wall Street shares dipped at the open on worries about reaching a final deal.Last Friday, the US agreed to hold off on a planned 25%-30% tariff increase on Chinese imports that was due to come into effect on Tuesday. It followed two days of talks in Washington between Liu He, China's vice-premier, and US officials.President Donald Trump, who described the talks as a ""love fest"", said the preliminary deal would take about five weeks to complete.He added that he might sign the deal alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping at a United Nations summit in Chile in December.However, Chinese officials have been more cautious about the outcome, simply claiming there had been progress between the countries.US officials also warned last week that tariffs on a different set of Chinese goods, which are due to go into effect in December, remained an option.Mr Mnuchin told CNBC: ""I have every expectation if there's not a deal, those tariffs would go in place - but I expect we'll have a deal.""There are still major issues to be negotiated, including industrial subsidies and cybertheft.Mr Mnuchin said more trade negotiations at various levels would take place over the coming weeks, including a phone call between himself, US Trade Representative Lighthizer, and Mr Liu.Despite the treasury secretary's caution, analysts said it still look as if talks were progressing. ""Investors are trying to wrap their head around this 'non deal',"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth, in New York.""If (the market) was really sceptical, it would be selling off a lot harder. But it's not because there are some good points to it - that they are still talking and potentially reaching a deal.""Asked on CNBC about a dispute between China and the US National Basketball Association, stemming from a tweet by Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey expressing support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, Mr Mnuchin said he hoped the two sides could come to a solution.Have you been getting these songs wrong?What happens to your body in extreme heat?"
